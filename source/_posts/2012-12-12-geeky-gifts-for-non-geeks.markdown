Here's what I'm getting my (non-geeky) family and friends for christmas.

##MaKey MaKey

The video explains it all really, the [Makey Makey](http://www.makeymakey.com/) is a very easy to use thingamabob that lets you replace a computer keyboard with anything that conducts electricity.

##LadyAda coloring book

Why settle for a normal colouring book when you can sneak in some geeky vocabulary in there. [E is for Elecontronics](http://www.adafruit.com/coloringbook) is both fun and educational.

And if you want crayons to go with the set, I reccomend this one which have super cute and awesome chemical names:

##Bare Conductive Card set

For the sort of people who like to do scrapbooking or make their own cards, add a bit more bling with this Bare Conductive LED Xmas card set. [Bare Conductive](http://www.bareconductive.com) does paint that conducts electricity, which can be used on loads of materials, not just paper/cardboard.

##Lego creationary

One of my favourite family friendly board games, it's like pictionary but instead of drawing you have to build it in lego. Available from the likes of amazon, argos, waterstones etc.

##Makie Doll with brains

[Makie Dolls](http://makie.me) let you design your own doll, but the coolest bit is the head has room for electronics, and can easily fit a lilypad arduino kit so you can also program your doll :D

##Sugru

What to get the person who has everything? [Sugru](http://sugru.com) is the perfect answer. I belive everyone would benefit from some sugru in their lives. I'm getting this for my parents, aunt, uncle, cousins, grandma ++
